This small social media project is a web application that allows users to create accounts, post updates, like posts, and comment on them. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while the backend is powered by Node.js with Express and MongoDB for data storage. The application includes essential features such as user authentication (signup, login, and logout), the ability to create, edit, and delete posts, as well as interact with other users by liking and commenting on posts. Users can also view a feed displaying all posts. The project follows a RESTful API structure, with endpoints for handling authentication, post creation, and user interactions. To set up the project, clone the repository, install the required dependencies using npm install, configure environment variables (such as database connection and JWT secret), and start the server using npm start.
