False: On the decision boundary, prior probabilities of both classes do not have to be equal.
True: On the decision boundary, the posterior probabilities of both classes must be equal.
True: On the decision boundary, class-conditioned probability densities corresponding to both classes must be equal.
False: The class-conditioned probability densities must be equal at the boundary.

Correct answer: The two models will have the same slope but different intercepts.
Since class 1 is duplicated in Dataset B, the relative weight of priors will shift, but the slope (determined by the covariance) remains unchanged.
LDA Properties
False: LDA does not minimize the inter-class variance; it maximizes the separation.
True: LDA maximizes the inter-class variance relative to the intra-class variance.
True: Maximizing Fisher information results in the same separating hyperplane direction as equating posterior probabilities.
False: The separating hyperplane remains the same.
Logistic Regression vs. LDA
False: For any dataset, logistic regression and LDA do not always learn the same boundary.
True: Adding outliers affects LDA more due to covariance estimation.
False: Logistic regression is less sensitive to outliers than LDA.
True: If class distributions deviate significantly from Gaussian, logistic regression generally performs better than LDA.

𝑛
n points could be on the margin when no points are misclassified.
Effect of Increasing

C in Soft-Margin SVM
Answer: Generally decreases
When

LDA vs. Logistic Regression Decision Boundaries

LDA Decision Boundary Properties
False: On the decision boundary, prior probabilities of both classes do not have to be equal.
True: On the decision boundary, the posterior probabilities of both classes must be equal.
True: On the decision boundary, class-conditioned probability densities corresponding to both classes must be equal.
False: The class-conditioned probability densities must be equal at the boundary.
LDA on Two Different Datasets
Correct answer: The two models will have the same slope but different intercepts.
Since class 1 is duplicated in Dataset B, the relative weight of priors will shift, but the slope (determined by the covariance) remains unchanged.
LDA Properties
False: LDA does not minimize the inter-class variance; it maximizes the separation.
True: LDA maximizes the inter-class variance relative to the intra-class variance.
True: Maximizing Fisher information results in the same separating hyperplane direction as equating posterior probabilities.
False: The separating hyperplane remains the same.
Logistic Regression vs. LDA
False: For any dataset, logistic regression and LDA do not always learn the same boundary.
True: Adding outliers affects LDA more due to covariance estimation.
False: Logistic regression is less sensitive to outliers than LDA.
True: If class distributions deviate significantly from Gaussian, logistic regression generally performs better than LDA.

ϕ(x)=[1,x 
2
 ] introduces a quadratic feature, which can make a previously non-linearly separable dataset linearly separable in a transformed space.
Hinge Loss in Binary Classification

)
L=max(0,1−y(w⋅x))
If

y(w⋅x)≥1, then 
𝐿
=

L=0.
The loss is not necessarily zero when the prediction is exactly equal to the true label because hinge loss penalizes small margins.
Maximum Number of Support Vectors in Hard-Margin SVM
Answer: n
In the worst case, all points can be support vectors, meaning all 
𝑛
n points could be on the margin when no points are misclassified.
Effect of Increasing 
𝐶
C in Soft-Margin SVM
Answer: Generally decreases
When 
𝐶
C is high, the model prioritizes minimizing misclassification over maximizing the margin, leading to fewer support vectors (i.e., only points near the boundary remain support vectors).

You can load the dataset and use SVC(kernel='poly', degree=3, C=1, gamma=0.1) in sklearn to determine the non-support vector.

Decision trees can be used for:

 A.  Classification only
 B.  Regression only
 C.  Both classification and regression
 D.  Neither of classification and regression
ChatGPT said:
Here are the correct answers:

Decision Tree Algorithm Type
Answer: A. Classification
Decision trees are primarily used for classification, though they can also be used for regression (CART - Classification and Regression Trees).
Leaf Nodes in Decision Trees
Answer: B. Classes
Leaf nodes represent the final classification decision.
Non-Leaf Nodes in Decision Trees
Answer: A. Attributes
Non-leaf nodes correspond to attributes that split the data.
Criteria for Splitting in Decision Trees
Answer: C. Entropy
Entropy (or Gini index) is used to decide the best attribute for splitting.
Logical Representation of Decision Trees
Answer: C. The internal nodes in a branch are connected by AND and the branches by OR
A path from the root to a leaf represents a conjunction (AND) of conditions, and different branches are combined using OR.
Purpose of Pruning in Decision Trees
Answer: B. Improving generalization performance
Pruning helps in avoiding overfitting and improves test performance.
Attribute with Highest Information Gain at Root
Answer: A. A1
Information gain is computed using entropy reduction, and A1 provides the highest reduction in entropy.
Entropy Calculation at Root
Answer: B. –(4/10) × log(4/10) – (6/10) × log(6/10)
This is the standard entropy formula:

)
=

/
10
p(normal)=6/10.
Entropy Reduction for Splitting on A1
Answer: B. –(4/10) × log(4/10) – (6/10) × log(6/10) + (4/7) × log(4/7) + (3/7) × log(3/7)
Entropy reduction = Entropy before split – Weighted entropy after split.
Entropy Reduction for Splitting on A2
Answer: C. –(4/10) × log(4/10) – (6/10) × log(6/10) + (3/4) × log(3/4) + (1/4) × log(1/4) + (1/6) × log(1/6) + (5/6) × log(5/6)
The entropy reduction formula is applied to A2's split.
Use Cases of Decision Trees
Answer: C. Both classification and regression
Decision trees can be used for both classification (C4.5, ID3) and regression (CART).

This small social media project is a web application that allows users to create accounts, post updates, like posts, and comment on them. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while the backend is powered by Node.js with Express and MongoDB for data storage. The application includes essential features such as user authentication (signup, login, and logout), the ability to create, edit, and delete posts, as well as interact with other users by liking and commenting on posts. Users can also view a feed displaying all posts. The project follows a RESTful API structure, with endpoints for handling authentication, post creation, and user interactions. To set up the project, clone the repository, install the required dependencies using npm install, configure environment variables (such as database connection and JWT secret), and start the server using npm start.
